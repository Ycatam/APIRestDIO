# Second challenge at AMDOCS Bootcamp!

+ In this challenge we developed a small API to manage people. +

Important things that I've learned:

* Initial Setup using Spring Boot Initialzr

* Developed functions such as reading, deleting, adding new inputs in a Heroku DB

* The use of lombok to remove getters and setters from the code.

And a lot of new annotations to reminder and consult latter.

I'll try to improve this latter, because I know that my knowledge is still growing.

Send me a messagem if you want to test thgis API, because my Heroku always get logged off.
